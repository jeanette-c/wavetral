Wavetral - convert between single cycle waveforms and audio spectra
Copyright (c) 2021 Jeanette C., <jeanette@juliencoder.de>

SUMMARY
wavetral is a small program to convert single cycle waveforms to spectra and
vice versa. It supports different input and output formats to export
your waveforms/spectra from one synthesizer to another.
It ONLY works on synth ready waveforms! If a waveform is read it is assumed
that it is ONE COMPLETE cycle of a wave.

FEATURES
	* Read multiple formats: audio (.wav and .aiff files), Waldorf Microwave
		II/XT, Csound (ftsave(k), plaintext with one value per line
	* Write multiple formats: audio (.wav and .aiff), plaintext with one value
		per line and Yoshimi scripts (to be run locally in the wave context
		of the AddSynth voices or the PadSynth
	* If possible detects input and output format
	* Resampling between audio formats
	* Changing the number of harmonics between different spectral formats
	* List available waveforms inside a Microwave II/XT wave dump file
